ArtBrains ArtClub Topic on Generics in Java Puzzlers

## Answer to Pazzlers with explanations

1. --Clone.java--
  * Well, a quite easy puzzler. Despite we ensure compiler that generic < T > extends Clonable, we still get compilation error - *'clone() has protected access in java.lang.Object'*
2. --Compressor.java--
  * For the first time everything looks OK. But, after a closer look you notice that we create instance of class Compressor without any generic parametrization. Even if don't use it anywhere in code thus will brack everything up due to type erasure. We will no longer have 2 generalized overload methods, but methods with raw types. And when runtime will get this code, he will try to use the narrowest method he could - *int compress(List list)* and will throw __ClassCastException__ in there: we really cann't cast String to int :(
3. --ConcreateList.java--
  * Well, it's not an easy one. The program will fail with __ClassCastException__ with (java.lang.Object; cannot be cast to Ljava.lang.String). To get why this is happening you should learn about bridge methods which are synthetically generated by compiler. If you will look into compiled classes you'll find that Java compiler eliminate generics with casts in ConcreateList class- _stringList.addNotNull(new String[]{"null", null})_, **BUT** in abstract DefaulList implementation is different - _this.add(new Object[]{element})_ and thus will give you an exception described above.
